# DEMO ANSWERS FOR COURSE 2: COMMUNICATION & PLANNING TOGETHER

## HOW THE APP WORKS

### Real App (Full Version):
1. Both partners access the course independently on their own devices
2. Each partner submits their answers without seeing the other's responses
3. Answers are stored in a database
4. The system compares both answers when both have submitted
5. Partners can only proceed when answers match
6. Partners can go back and change answers until they reach agreement

### Demo Version:
- Simulates Partner A's answer with predefined "correct" answers
- When you submit, it validates against these simulated partner answers
- Demonstrates the validation logic without requiring a backend
- You can test the validation by intentionally selecting wrong answers first
